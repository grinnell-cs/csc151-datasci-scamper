title: Transforming lists
summary: |
  We investigate a particular form of decomposition relevant in computing in which transformations over a collection of values are really transformations of the individual elements of the collection.

Imagine representing the collection of yearly salaries found at a startup using a simple list, for example:

<pre class="scamper source">
(define salaries (list 100000 100000 50000 75000 500000))
</pre>

And now imagine computing everyone's updated salary after a standard [cost-of-living adjustment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cola.asp) (COLA).
We might decompose this problem into the problem of computing *one* person's updated salary.
Let's take the first person whom makes `100000` (units deliberately unspecified) as an example.
The Social Security COLA for 2020 was [%1.6](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/colasummary.html), so we can calculate the updated salary using arithmetic:

<pre class="scamper source">
(+ 100000 (* 100000 0.016))
</pre>

And we can abstract this into a function that computes the updated salary when given a salary:

<pre class="scamper source">
;;; (compute-cola-salary salary) -> number?
;;;   salary : number?, non-negative
;;; Returns the given salary, updated for cost-of-living.
(define compute-cola-salary
  (lambda (salary) 
    (+ salary (* salary 0.016))))
</pre>

Good!
We can now calculate the updated salary for any person.
However, how do we do this for a *collection* of salaries, a collection represented as a list?

Note that the calculation of each salary is *independent* of the other salaries.
That is, someone's adjusted salary only depends on their salary and not other salaries.
In this situation, we simply want to apply our solution for a single person, `compute-cola-salary`, to every element of the list.
We say that we want to *lift* the function `compute-cola-salary` from operating on a single salary to a list of salaries.

In Scheme, we realize the behavior of *lifting a function to a list of values* with the `map` function:

<pre class="scamper source">
(define salaries (list 100000 100000 50000 75000 500000))

(define compute-cola-salary
  (lambda (salary)
    (+ salary (* salary 0.016))))

(map compute-cola-salary salaries)

salaries
</pre>

Note that the `map` procedure does not affect the original list.

## The `map` procedure

`map` is a powerful procedure!
It allows to concisely describe how to transform the values of a list in terms of an operation over a single element of the list.
Let's break down how you use `map`.

`map` itself is a function of two arguments as seen in our above example.

+   The first argument is a function that transforms a single element of the list.
    By "transform", we mean the function:

    -   Takes as an input an element of the list.
    -   Produces as an output the result of transforming that element.

    In our above example, `compute-cola-salary` is a function that transforms an old salary into a new, adjusted salary.

+   The second argument is a list that contains the elements that we wish to transform.

Any transformation function over salaries can be passed in to our call to `map`, for example, the startup might have [gone public](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-does-going-public-mean/) so everyone gets their salary doubled:

<pre class="scamper source">
(define salaries (list 100000 100000 50000 75000 500000))

(define double-salary
  (lambda (salary)
    (* salary 2)))

(map double-salary salaries)
</pre>

The startup might have hit a downturn and needs to reduce their salaries:

<pre class="scamper source">
(define salaries (list 100000 100000 50000 75000 500000))

(define downsize
  (lambda (salary)
    (/ salary 2)))

(map downsize salaries)
</pre>

Or worse yet, the downturn might be so bad that the startup needs to do the right thing and let go of its higher-earning employees to stay under budget:

<pre class="scamper source">
(define salaries (list 100000 100000 50000 75000 500000))

(define should-keep
  (lambda (salary)
    (< salary 75000)))

(map should-keep salaries)
</pre>

Observe that we have transformed our list of salaries into a list of booleans indicating whether we should keep the employee with that salary.

## The `apply` procedure

`apply` is a helpful standard library function when working with lists of arguments. `apply` takes two arguments:

+   A function to run or *apply* on a collection of arguments.
+   The collection of arguments to apply to the function, stored in a list.

As a simple example of `apply`, consider the simple `(+)` function which can take any number of arguments:

<pre class="scamper source">
(+ 1 2 3 4 5)
</pre>

While `(+)` takes any number of arguments, it cannot take a *single list* as an argument:

<pre class="scamper source">
(+ (list 1 2 3 4 5))
</pre>

To pass this list of numbers to `(+)`, we can use the `apply` function:

<pre class="scamper source">
(apply + (list 1 2 3 4 5))
</pre>

## Thinking with types

As you've likely discovered already, it is important that we use the correct types when
we run our procedures.  With both `map` and `apply`, we have to think a bit more deeply
about types.

What are the types of the inputs to `map`?

That's a real question.  Take a minute and think about it.

We mean it.

Hopefully, you said something like 

> `map` takes two inputs.  The first is a procedure.  The second is a list of values.

But there's more to it than that.  There's a relationship between the procedure and
the list of values.  In particular, *the procedure much be applicable to each value
in the list*.  Let's consider two simple examples.

You may remember that `square` computes the square of a number and `string-upcase` converts
a string to upper case.  

<pre class="scamper source">
(square 5)
(string-upcase "quiet")
</pre>

If we're using `map`, we should use `square` with lists of numbers and `string-upcase` with
lists of numbers.

<pre class="scamper source">
(range 6)
(map square (range 6))
(string-split "please be quiet not loud" " ")
(map string-upcase (string-split "please be quiet not loud" " "))
</pre>

But what happens if we don't match types?  Let's see.

<pre class="scamper source">
(map square (string-split "please be quite not loud" " "))
(map string-upcase (range 6))
</pre>

You'll note that we get errors.  Are they the errors you expected?  It might be
nicer if Scamper more explicitly told us that the elements of the list were not 
the correct types for the procedure.  But it's done that in its own way.

What if we do something even stranger, such as writing something other than a
procedure in the procedure position, or something other than a list in the
list position?  Let's try.

<pre class="scamper source">
(map 5 (list 1 2 3))
(map square 5)
</pre>

It's good to see that these error messages are clear.  Let's do our best to remember
those so that when we see them, we know what's gone wrong.

Next, let's move on to `apply`.  Like `map`, `apply` takes a procedure and a list
as parameters.  While `map` applies the procedure element by element, `apply`
applies the procedure to the elements _en masse_, as it were.

<pre class="scamper source">
(apply * (list 2 3 4))
(apply string-append (list "this" "and" "that"))
</pre>

Once again, we should see what happens if we give incorrect types.

<pre class="scamper source">
(apply * (list 2 3 4))
(apply string-append (list "this" "and" "that"))
(apply * (list "this" "and" "that"))
(apply * (list 2 3 "four"))
(apply string-append (list 2 3 4))
(apply 2 (list 2 3 4))
(apply 2 3)
(apply + 2 3 4)
</pre>

We will need to practice reading error messages like those.  But each is saying, in
essence, "you got the types wrong".

## Mental models: Tracing `map` and `apply`

As we've seen, it's useful to be able to trace our Scheme code by hand to consider
what Scheme is doing (or at least what we think it's doing) and, therefore,
why we get the results or errors that we do.  And you already know many aspects of
the mental model for doing so, particularly the rule that you evaluate arguments
before applying a procedure and that you use substitution for user-defined procedures.

+   Evaluating `(map f (list v1 v2 ... vk))` is equivalent to evaluating `(list (f v1) (f v2) ... (f vk))`.
+   Evaluating `(apply f (list v1 v2 ... vk))` is equivalent to evaluating `(f v1 v2 ... vk)`

So let's try an example.

```racket
(define dub
  (lambda (x)
    (* 2 x)))

;     (apply + (map dub (range 3 8 2)))
; --> (apply + (map dub (list 3 5 7)))
; --> (apply + (list (dub 3) (dub 5) (dub 7)))
; --> (apply + (list 6 (dub 5) (dub 7)))
; --> (apply + (list 6 10 (dub 7)))
; --> (apply + (list 6 10 14))
; --> (+ 6 10 14)
; --> 30

```

Note that when we're working with lists, it's helpful to explicitly write `(list ...)`, which
reminds us that we're dealing with a list and not an expression to further evaluate.

While we'll rarely write out all of these steps, it helps to keep them in mind as
we think about what `map` and `apply` are doing.  And we will, on occasion, pull
out a piece of paper (or an electronic document) to think through part of the
steps of an evaluation.

## Self-checks

### Self-check 1 (Differences) (â€¡)

Write a function `decrement` that takes an integer as input and returns an integer *one less* than the input.

Now use `decrement` and `map` to write an expression that `decrements` the contents of the following list *three times*:

```racket
(define example-list (list 10 20 30 40 50))
```
