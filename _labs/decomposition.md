title: Algorithmic decomposition
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will practice algorithmic decomposition.
---

In the reading, we introduced the foundational technique of *algorithmic decomposition* where we express a complex problem in terms of smaller, easier-to-solve problems.
We can decompose *any* problem, no matter the domain.
This lab will give you some experience decomposing problems as well as typing out basic Scamper code.

### Introducing Pair Programming

For these next four exercises, we will continue to try out *pair programming*.
Pair programming is a particular discipline of collaborative programming that we will be using extensively in our lab work.
We'll have more to say in the coming weeks about the nitty-gritty of working in pairs, but we would like you to dive head-first into the experience.

+ One person, the *driver*, will be in control of keyboard.  
  They will often take the lead on designing and coding a solution, speaking aloud about their design thoughts as they work.
+ The other person, the *navigator*, helps keep them from going too far off track.
  They observe and consider strategic design issues.
  They look for potential problems and raise them with the driver.
  They try to keep track of time.

Between each exercise, you will swap driver and navigator roles so that you and your partner get experience with both roles.
If you are in a group of three, you will have two navigators and one driver!
Make sure to rotate roles so that everyone gets a turn as the driver.

To encourage appropriate swapping, we have labeled each problem as "A" and "B" for pairs.
Whoever is closer to the board is partner "A"
Whoever is further from the board is partner "B".
Partner A or Partner B drives as indicated in the lab.
If there is a third partner, ignore the labels and rotate appropriately.

You should begin by copying and opening the file
[decomposition.scm]({{ "/code/labs/decomposition.scm" | relative_url }}) (click on it) which contains spaces to answer the instructions you will find here.
In future labs, the file may contain instructions, code, and places to enter your answers.

In general, you will find that all of the instructions for the lab are in the linked file or files.
