Tokens are meant to give you the opportunity to revisit work from our course that challenged you the first time around. I hope this system will remove some of the pressure of “performance” in our course, since you may resubmit some things without penalty.

You may earn tokens by supporting your peers and being an active member of the Grinnell computer science community. Eligible opportunities will be listed at the start of each class. You will be limited to 6 total tokens, 3 supporting your peers and 3 attending academic events. You begin the course with **0 tokens**.

You may use one token to resubmit a Coding Challenge. You may not resubmit a coding challenge which you did not turn in. This system is meant to encourage you to take a second look at concepts that you may have struggled with initially, not as a way to turn in things late. Coding Challenges must show a good faith effort initially in order to be revised. The same collaboration policies apply as in the original submission.

## Earning tokens

In general, you can earn tokens on top in one of three ways:

+ You can attend one of the regular CS department events, such as CS table (lunchtime conversations) or CS extras (talks).
+ You can attend certain other designated campus events, such as Scholars' Convocation, when they have topical relevance to our class.
+ You can support your classmates by attending their performances or competitions.

Token-bearing events will be announced in class.

To earn tokens by attending events, attend the event and then submit a one-paragraph reflection **within 72 hours** to your instructor via email. Use [151-XX Token] as the subject line of your email, where you replace XX with your section number.

Note that a reflection is not the same as a description.  I'm interested in hearing, for example, what you took away from the event or surprising things you observed.




## FAQ
**Q: How can I earn a token?**

A: Attend an approved event. Upcoming events will be announced at the beginning of each class period. Then email the instructor (see next question).


**Q: I attended an approved event. How do I get my token?**

A: Send your instructor an email within 72 hours of your attendance. Use the subject line [151-XX Token] where you replace XX with either 03 or 04 for your section number. See the info above on _Earning tokens_ for more information. 


**Q: I attended something that wasn’t listed during class, and I think it should count.**

A: The very best thing to do is to always bring up your suggested events during class before it occurs to get approval. You can ask me about it after the event, but know that since there are so many eligible opportunities I present during class, I am less inclined to approve things after the fact.


**Q: Can I participate in an extra credit opportunity before I need any resubmissions?**

A: Yes, participate in up to six activities at any time, and cash in on your tokens as you need them.


**Q: Can I “use” a token before I’ve earned it? Can I submit a revision before earning a token?**

A: Yes, participate in up to six activities at any time, and cash in on your tokens as you need them. At the end of the semester if you haven’t earned enough tokens, your grade will be adjusted appropriately.


**Q: If I earn a token, do I need to complete a revision within a particular time frame?**

A: No, participate in up to six activities at any time, and cash in on your tokens as you need them.


**Q: When are revisions due?**

A: If you would like to use a token, the only hard deadline is 5pm on the last day of finals. However, you are only allowed to submit at most 2 resubmissions in any given week (Sunday – Saturday), so you will need to plan to complete some things before the last week of the semester. Additionally, some later coding challenges may not be graded fast enough for there to be time for a resubmission.


**Q: What if I resubmit a coding challenge, and I still don’t get the grade I want. May I resubmit it again?**

A: You may, by using another token.


**Q: May I use a token for coding challenge that I didn’t turn in?**

A: You may not. This system is meant to encourage you to take a second look at concepts that you may have struggled with initially, not as a way to turn in things late. Homework problems in particular must show a good faith effort initally in order to be resubmitted.


**Q: Can I use a token to turn in something late? To redo a lab? To redo reading questions?**

A: No. Tokens are not meant for low stakes assignments (labs and reading questions), for which you should typically get full credit by turning it in on time. Every coding challenge may be turned in up to 48 hours late (no token needed) without penalty. Assignments are not accepted after 48 hours. 


**Q: Can I use a token to redo a quiz problem?**

A: No tokens are needed for quiz problems, you have the opportunity to redo those automatically.
